          <p>
            Anaheim Electronics, founded in the late Universal Century,
            specifically in UC 0084, emerged as a key player in the development
            of mobile suits.
            <span class="abbreviate-p"
              >Originally a subsidiary of the powerful Federation, Anaheim was
              established to innovate and produce advanced mobile weaponry in
              response to escalating conflicts. By UC 0093, the company gained
              prominence for its role in developing iconic mobile suits like the
              RX-93 ν Gundam and the RGM-89 Jegan. Throughout the Universal
              Century, Anaheim's contributions significantly influenced the
              balance of power in the ongoing wars, marking its legacy in the
              Gundam universe as a vital force in mobile suit engineering and
